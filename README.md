# Ionic_Liquid 
This is part of the Lanthanide separations using Ionic liquids where I developed a GAFF model to describe the inter and intra molecular interactions using antechamber. For this I used GROMACS as the MD Simulation Engine. I optimized the structures using Gaussian and got the partial atomic charges using Restrained ELectrostatic Potential Method.
